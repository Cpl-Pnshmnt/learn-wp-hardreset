h1. Learn WordPress - hardreset version

This is a very basic WordPress theme meant to assist new web developers in gaining a very basic knowledge of WordPress, while allowing them to hone their skills in basic markup and CSS.

No PHP skills are required - the aim of this theme is to showcase the WordPress environment, while providing a dynamic platform suitable for basic HTML and CSS skills development.

A hard reset is used in this theme both to illustrate what methods have been used in the past to create a consistent base, and to illustrate the pitfalls of using such a reset.

The theme is provided as is, with no styling. A graphic or screenshot of a basic design should be provided to the learner, who should then attempt to implement that design using this theme.

**Note:** The !graphics folder is for the purpose of this repo ONLY. Graphics files not explicitly used by a theme should not be made part of the theme, and thus not included in any environment; development or production.

h2. Prerequisites

h3. Text Editor

A good text editor makes all the difference in the learning process. I recommend "Sublime Text":http://www.sublimetext.com/2 as it is well featured, has an active community behind it, and is available on all platforms.

h3. Setup A Local Server

To run WordPress, you'll need a server running PHP, and MySQL. There are a number of easy to setup Apache servers which will do a lot of the heavy lifting for you:
# "Windows: install WAMP":http://www.wikihow.com/Install-WAMP
# "Mac: install MAMP":http://sawmac.com/mamp/
# "Linux: install LAMP":http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/288158-easy-lamp-server-installation

h3. Use Git

Before working on any of the source, a basic knowledge of version control systems and Git is useful:

Some great resources for installing and learning how to use Git:
