h1. Learn WordPress - hardreset version

This is a very basic WordPress theme meant to assist new web developers in gaining a very basic knowledge of WordPress, while allowing them to hone their skills in basic markup and CSS.

No PHP skills are required - the aim of this theme is to showcase the WordPress environment, while providing a dynamic platform suitable for basic HTML and CSS skills development.

A hard reset is used in this theme both to illustrate what methods have been used in the past to create a consistent base, and to illustrate the pitfalls of using such a reset.

The theme is provided as is, with no styling. A graphic or screenshot of a basic design should be provided to the learner, who should then attempt to implement that design using this theme.
